## Pong

# Creating a game of pong in two stages.
1) Computer vs. Player
   In this project, I developed a Pong game with an added twistâ€”machine learning capabilities. 
   Using machine learning techniques, the game's AI opponent learns and adapts to the player's gameplay patterns over time. The AI opponent starts with basic skills but progressively improves its performance, making each game more engaging and competitive. It analyzes the player's strategies, reacts to their shots, and employs intelligent decision-making to counter their moves.
2) Computer vs. Computer
   In this project i added a brain to both player just for the testing
